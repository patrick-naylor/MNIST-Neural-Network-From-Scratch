# Neural Network of MNIST Dataset From Scratch
This is a simple exercise where I created a neural network using only linear algebra and multivariable calculus. This model achieved over 90% accuracy over a test sample of 10000 samples. The neural network has two hidden layers of 72 and 36 nodes respectively.
For more information and to see the model in work please open the jupyter notebook.
